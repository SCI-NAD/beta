<!-- This component is currently not being used by the website -->
<!-- If theme switching functionality is required in the future, consider implementing it using: -->
<!-- 1. CSS variables for theming -->
<!-- 2. A simpler JavaScript or framework-specific solution -->
<!-- 3. Leveraging built-in dark mode support in modern browsers -->

<!-- For now, this file can be safely removed from the project. -->
<!-- Make sure to update any components or files that may have been importing or using this ThemeProvider. -->

<!-- If you decide to implement theme switching in the future, consider using a more maintainable and -->
<!-- accessible approach that doesn't rely on changing themes through local storage. -->

<!-- The original code has been commented out for reference: -->
<!--
<script is:inline>
	const doc = document.firstElementChild;
	const localStorageTheme = localStorage.getItem('theme');

	if (localStorageTheme !== null) {
		doc.setAttribute('data-theme', localStorageTheme);
	}
</script>
-->
