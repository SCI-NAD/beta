// This file has been removed as it was deemed unnecessary for the current project requirements.
// If theme switching icons are needed in the future, consider implementing them using a more
// flexible and maintainable approach, such as:
// - Using an icon library
// - Implementing theme switching through CSS classes instead of SVG icons
// - Creating simpler, more abstract representations of themes

// import { html } from 'lit';

// export const classicThemeIcon = html`...`;
// export const darkThemeIcon = html`...`;

// The above code has been commented out and can be safely deleted if no longer needed.
// Ensure to update any components or files that may have been importing these icons.
