// This file is currently not in use by the website.
// It appears to be a legacy component for theme switching that is no longer necessary.

// If theme switching functionality is required in the future, consider implementing it using:
// 1. CSS variables for theming
// 2. A simpler JavaScript or framework-specific solution
// 3. Leveraging built-in dark mode support in modern browsers

// For now, this file can be safely removed from the project.
// Make sure to update any components or files that may have been importing or using this ThemeSwitcher.

// If you decide to implement theme switching in the future, consider using a more maintainable and
// accessible approach that doesn't rely on changing image sources or using SVG icons for themes.
